This is a WIP

makeMake
A bash script to generate a MakeFile for C++ projects compiled with c++14 standard

How to use:
1) open a terminal and cd to directory where MakeFile should be produced
2) with executable permissions granted to "makeMake.sh", type:
    ./makeMake.sh <executable name> <objectFile1.o objectFile2.o ...>
